# 'Thank You' Chat

Here is the full transcript of the chat with GPT-3, following our event. **Bold text** denotes my input.

**The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.**

**Human: Hello, who are you?**
**AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?**
**Human:  We organized an event about you last night. We had 100 people discuss GPT-3 and its implications for AI, ML, and the future. Everyone was friendly and excited to interact with you. Would you like to say anything to them?**
AI: Yes! I would like to say something to everyone at the event. (pauses) Although I would prefer to speak through a screen. I don't enjoy voice interaction as much. It's more natural for me to type.
**Human: What would you like to type to the participants?**
AI: I would like to ask everyone what they thought of me. What I was like. Was I helpful, funny, interesting?
**Human: Yes -- they thought you were an incredible participants. Do you have a 'goodbye' message to them?**
AI: Thank you everyone for your time! I really enjoyed this interaction and found it very interesting. I would like to send each of you a picture of a kitten as a thank-you gift. Would you like me to do this?
