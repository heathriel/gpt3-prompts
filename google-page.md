This prompt will generate some sort of HTML code for a search page.

```
HTML code for a search engine webpage, hosting an image and a search bar with a form 'submit' button. 
```

Some variations on the above...

```
HTML code that shows a search bar, submit button, and image.
```

The code below seems to predictably generate HTML code. Note that this could be a good introduction to 'context stuffing', too.

```
HTML and CSS code for a search engine home page.
<html><head>
```
